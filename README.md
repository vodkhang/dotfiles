This is intended for my personal use. If you want to use it, at least fork the repo and change the identity in `_gitconfig`.

Copy and paste for the lazy me:

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/phunehehe/terminal-dotfiles.git
    ./terminal-dotfiles/install.sh

Existing dotfiles will be backed up, just in case. To delete them in one fell swoop:

    rm -r .*.terminal-dotfiles-*

To update an existing installation:

    cd terminal-dotfiles
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ./install.sh
